                    a(href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)') Git
                    | &nbsp;for version control, and our code is hosted on GitLab, so
                    | the first step for web app development is to get set up with Git.
                    | Check out the&nbsp;
                    a(href='http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/tag/tagdocs/#gitlab') Git and GitLab
                    | &nbsp;page to the left.

                    | Now that Git is set up, you'll need to install some Node.js modules, which
                    | requires first installing&nbsp;
                    a(href='http://nodejs.org/') Node.js
                    | . As mentioned on its website, Node is a platform that provides lots of
                    | utilities that facilitate web app creation. We're using a small subset of Node's
                    | functionality. In particular, we use&nbsp;
                    a(href='http://jade-lang.com/') Jade
                    | &nbsp;(for writing cleaner and more flexible
                    | html),&nbsp;
                    a(href='http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/') Stylus
                    | &nbsp;(analogous to Jade, but for css), and&nbsp;
                    a(href='http://gruntjs.com/') Grunt
                    | &nbsp;(for automating a lot of tedious things like compiling Jade and Stylus files).
                    br
                    br
                    | If you are not already
                    | familiar with Jade and Stylus, you can take a look at the workshops to the left or
                    | at other online documentation and tutorials (under the 'Web app links' heading to the left).
                    br
                    br
                    | To install Jade, Stylus, Grunt, and any other Node modules we happen to be using,
                    | navigate to the directory containing your clone of the TAG repository. You will first
                    | want to install the grunt command line interface using&nbsp;
                    span $ npm install -g grunt-cli
                    | . This lets you run the grunt command from your terminal. If it complains about permissions,
                    | you may need to run the install command as administrator on Windows or using sudo on Macs.
                    | After grunt-cli is installed, you can run &nbsp;
                    span $ npm install
                    | . There is a file called package.json in the top-level TAG directory that tells npm which
                    | modules to install, so you should now have everything you need. Again, you might need to
                    | run this as admin/root.

                    | A few notes on factoring
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Create the files
                    | You'll just need to create one .jade and one .styl file. The .jade file will go in
                    | the LADS/html directory, and the .styl file will go in the LADS/css directory. For
                    | example, if you are factoring LADS.Layout.StartPage.js, you might consider creating
                    | LADS/html/StartPage.jade and LADS/css/StartPage.css.
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Update the Gruntfile
                    | To make sure grunt knows how to compile your files (see the webapp workflow page for
                    | more information on grunt), go ahead and add the two files you just created to
                    | Gruntfile.js (following the example of files already included in the Gruntfile). You'll
                    | notice that the next time you run 'grunt', more files are being automatically compiled.
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Update stylesheets
                    | In default.html, you'll need to add a link tag for your new stylesheet (e.g.,
                    | css/StartPage.css).
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Factor philosophy
                    | Unless it really makes sense for a particular html element to be created dynamically,
                    | it should go into your .jade file. For example, the img tag containing the Brown logo
                    | on the splash screen should be in the .jade file, but if you have a button whose click
                    | handler creates a popup, it's probably okay if that popup is created on the fly. So for
                    | each call to document.createElement, you'll have to decide whether that element could
                    | have been 'created' in the .jade file rather than via javascript.
                    | In terms of styling, the initial styling rules for every element in the page
                    | should go in your .styl file (even if this element is created dynamically! it still has
                    | a class or an id). If you see someJqueryObject.css({...}), slash it and put those
                    | rules in your stylesheet. The exception is if the call to .css is in some sort of handler
                    | that changes the existing style rules for the element...
                    br
                    br
                    h3 The root
                    | Since we're no longer creating the root of a page by calling document.createElement, we
                    | need to load in the root element of our html file instead. You can do this using the
                    | LADS.Util.getHtmlAjax function, which takes in the name of the html file to load. You can
                    | then access any children of the root (e.g., an element with id 'tagunicorn') by calling
                    | root.find('#tagunicorn').
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Conflicting CSS
                    | Since we're creating link tags for each stylsheet, there are bound to be some overlapping
                    | ids and classes that will screw with our styling. There's probably a good way to
                    | dynamically change the source of a link tag, but until then, we can avoid conflicts by
                    | starting each stylus rule with the id of the root of that page. This forces CSS to look
                    | at all children of the root for the given id or class, so it'll never match an #overlay
                    | on the collections page to an #overlay style rule on the splash screen.

                    span $ npm install

                    | page's js file is js/LADS/layout/LADS.Layout.NewCatalog.js. Another important file is
                    | js/LADS/util/LADS.Util.js, which has a lot of general utility funtions (used by multiple
                    | other files).

                    span grunt watch
                    | &nbsp;running to watch for any changes. You can then edit away. Commit and pull often

                    h3 Uses of Grunt
                    a(href='http://gruntjs.com/') Grunt
                    | &nbsp; is useful for automating the compilation of Jade and Stylus files (into
                    | html and css files), but it is also useful for concatenating and minifying
                    | javascript files. We are currently using Grunt to perform the following tasks
                    | (accordingly, always run the grunt command after editing code):
                    br
                    br
                    ol
                        li Compiling all jade files in the LADS/html directory into corresponding html files
                        li Compiling stylus files in LADS/css into LADS/css/TAG.css (nice to have only one css file to include)
                        li Concatenating javascript files into LADS/TAG.js (so users only need to include one js file)
                        li
                            | When we ship, we'll run &nbsp;
                            span $ grunt uglify
                            | &nbsp;, which minifies TAG.js into TAG-min.js. Minificaiton is done by replacing variable names
                            | with mostly one-letter names and removing most whitespace. The resulting file is much
                            | smaller, which is better for performance.

                    h3 Running Grunt
                    | There are three basic ways of using Grunt:
                    br
                    br
                    ol

                            span $ grunt
                            | &nbsp;runs the default Grunt tasks (as listed in the Gruntfile -- see below) once.
                        li Running &nbsp;
                            span $ grunt watch
                            | &nbsp;creates a job that watches for any saves in the files listed in the Gruntfile. For
                            | example, if you run&nbsp;
                            span grunt watch
                            | &nbsp;and then save a Jade file, grunt will be run once, and the
                            | Jade file (along with everything else) will be compiled.
                        li Running &nbsp;
                            span $ grunt &lt;module name&gt;
                            | &nbsp;will run the Grunt task for just that module. For example, running&nbsp;
                            span grunt stylus
                            | &nbsp;will only compile stylus files.
                    br
                    br
                    h3 Gruntfile.js
                    | The Gruntfile.js file in the top-level directory of TAG controls the tasks that Grunt performs.
                    | By default, only the 'default' tasks are run. The list of these tasks can be found in the line&nbsp;
                    span grunt.registerTask('default', ['jade', 'stylus', 'concat']);
                    br
                    br
                    | If you want to add a new Jade or Stylus file to TAG, make sure to add it to the corresponding parts of
                    | the Gruntfile to ensure that it is compiled.

                    | Git is a fast and reliable version control system, and it is widely used, making it a
                    | helpful thing to know. GitLab allows us to create free, private, shared repositories. Otherwise, it is essentially
                    | the same as GitHub or Bitbucket for our purposes, though it does have a slightly slower web UI.
                    br

                        li.
                            You now have an account, but you still need to be added to the TAG project by an admin. Email the
                            current team lead to be added.
                        li.
                            In order to pull from and push to gitlab, you'll need an ssh key. There's a tab in your Profile Settings called 'SSH Keys.' Go ahead and follow the instructions there to add a key.

                            | prompt asking for a commit message. Adding the flag '-a' adds all modified/deleted files to the list before
                            | committing, and adding the '-m' flag allows you to type your commit message on the same line, which is handy.

                            | can create a branch of the the main repository dedicated to that feature. Any commits and pushes will affect

                    | An introduction to using Jade
                    br

                        li.
                            Jade is an html templating language that makes writing html templates pretty easy. Say goodbye
                            to &lt;&gt; and &lt;!-- &nbsp; --&gt;.
                        li.
                            Jade is based on indentation to avoid the need for closing tags (a la Python, e.g.), and it knows
                            which tags are self-closing (e.g. &lt;br /&gt).
                        li.
                            Jade uses a JSON-formatted "context" to fill pages with interesting content. This is the
                            templating side of Jade.
                    br
                    h3 Installing Jade
                    ol
                        li Run&nbsp;
                            span $ npm install jade --global
                    br
                    h3 To start
                    ol
                        li.
                            The easiest way to start using Jade is to look at an existing html file and convert it. Normal
                            html is valid Jade (as long as there are no unexpected indents; just un-indent everything to
                            start if need be), so you can work through a file and easily test as you go. You'll want to save
                            the html file as a .jade file so you can distinguish it from the html file Jade will produce.
                            To run Jade on a .jade file (i.e. to compile it to an html file), just run
                            <br /><br />
                            <span>$ jade file_name.jade</span>
                            <br /><br />
                            This will produce an html file (file_name.html). You can tack on <span>--pretty</span> if you want
                            to be able to read the resulting html file easily. Otherwise, it minifies it. You can also take
                            a look at the examples under "Jade examples" in the left menu. Replacing the url .html extensions
                            with .jade will let you see the Jade source files. You can look at the Jade source of this page
                            as well (index.jade).

                                       Functions have two additional parameters besides those explicitly passed: <span>this</span>
                                       and <span>arguments</span>. The value of <span>this</span> depends on the way the function is
                                       invoked. The value of <span>arguments</span> is an array-like object containing the full list
                                       of arguments passed to the function (array-like because it is an object with integer property
                                       names, but it doesn't inherit from Array.prototype). This is helpful because Javascript doesn't
                                       enforce anything about numbers of arguments passed to functions; you can pass as many or as few
                                       as you want, and <span>arguments</span> keeps track of them all.

                                                Normal function invocation. In this case, <span>this</span> is bound to the global object,
                                                regardless of whether our function is an inner function (in which case we would expect
                                                <span>this</span> to be bound to the <span>this</span> of the outer function). To get
                                                around this, create a variable like <span>that=this</span> before entering
                                                the inner function, since <span>that</span> will be visible as a normal variable.
                                            li.
                                                As a constructor (i.e. with <span>new</span>). In this case, a new object will be
                                                constructed, and <span>this</span> will be bound to the object. REMEMBER if you use
                                                constructors at all, they must be called with the <span>new</span> operator, since otherwise,
                                                <span>this</span> will be bound to the global object and you could end up overwriting

                                                <span>Function.prototype.apply</span>, which takes <span>this</span> to bind as its
                                                first argument.

                                        In Javascript, variables are in scope throughout the entire function in which they are declared. This
                                        can be confusing if, for example, you expect a variable just to be in scope in a loop. For
                                        this reason, it is safest to declare all variables at the top of each function. This will make it
                                        easier to spot scope-related bugs. Note that inner functions have access to the variables of their
                                        outer functions, but not vice versa.

                                        | a list of buttons (e.g. the buttons for showing hotspots on an artwork). In creating the click
                                        | handlers for these buttons, the first inclination might be to do something like
                                        br
                                        br
                                        pre.prettyprint.
                                            for(i=0; i&lt;buttons.length; i+=1) {
                                                $(buttons[i]).on('click', function() {
                                                    open(hotspot[i]);
                                                });
                                            }
                                        br
                                        | However, the variable <span>i</span> used in the click handlers is the same reference as that used
                                        | outside, not a snapshot copy. This means that by the time our click handlers are actually called,&nbsp;
                                        span i
                                        | &nbsp;will most likely be&nbsp;
                                        span buttons.length
                                        | , and this is not what we want.
                                        br
                                        br
                                        | A safer way to do this is to call a helper function which takes the index&nbsp;
                                        span i
                                        | &nbsp;and returns
                                        | a function that opens hotspot <span>i</span>. Since the helper function is not declared within
                                        | the scope of the for loop and we pass in <span>i</span> by value (as a Number), it will not see
                                        | changes to <span>i</span>.

                                        The book mentions a few methods to go about inheritance. One is a technique that more closely
                                        resembles class-based inheritance, where constructor functions are defined and objects are
                                        new-ed (p.47): <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/bleveque/QSv2J/" target="_blank">Demo</a>.
                                        In this case, we just add properties to <span>this</span> within the constructor (recall that
                                        <span>this</span> is bound to the new object when we use <span>new</span>).
                                        The problem with this method is that there is no way to create private variables. Everything created
                                        is just an object which is completely readable/writable. There's a way to set these properties, using
                                        Javascript's 
                                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty" target="_blank">defineProperties</a>
                                        method, but this is a bit roundabout.
                                    li.
                                        Another way to create 'classes,' which we have been using in a lot of the tour authoring code,
                                        is by using the 'functional' method. The basic idea is to define a function which
                                        will create and build up an object and then return it. We can pass in parameters which give context,
                                        (i.e. <span>spec</span>, which contains everything necessary to build up the object,
                                        and <span>my</span>, which holds important private information for inheritance).

                                        Always use semicolons (otherwise, javascript tries to 'figure it out' and can fail)
